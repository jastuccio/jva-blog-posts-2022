I want to redirect all non-www traffic to www on my website.

You may be able to do this with [Netlify Lambda functions?](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/) I decided to create the redirect in gatsby-node.js because I felt more comfortable creating it there.

> if you’re running a build command or site generator, the \_redirects file should end up in the folder you’re deploying ~ [Netlify redirect docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/)

```js
// include node fs module
var fs = require('fs');

// writeFile function with filename, content and callback function
fs.writeFile('_redirects', 'Learn Node FS module', function(err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File is created successfully.');
});
```
