# Blog posts for [my personal website](https://astucc.io)

The plan is to store my personal and tech blog posts under version control.

- tech posts will be syncronized on my site and on [dev.to](https://dev.to/jastuccio)
- personal posts will only appear on my website

## Benefits to this approach

1 Typos can be corrected by my readers using a pull request

- All my posts will be under version control
- Future proof - blog posts can be imported when/if I update the framework that powers my site
